# Post-Quantum Safe PKI Demonstration

- Based on liboqs from the Linux Foundation's [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/) project

- Demonstration is with mock employee records containing sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), but can be used to encrypt/decrypt any sensitive file

- Uses Kyber1024 for key encapsulation and AES-256 for encryption

- Need to have [liboqs-python](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python) wrapper in your path

-python requirements: oqs, cryptography
